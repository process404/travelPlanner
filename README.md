# Travel Planner

This was created to enable creatng physical printed tables for travel days and individual journeys per day(s), aswell as adding useful transport info and specific notes attached to each travel leg. It also attaches a spare row at the bottom of the table so that extra plans can be added or altered plans can be made if required. 

------
> [!NOTE]
> What this planner does **not** do
> - Making notes / logs of journeys or transportation detail
> - Does not account for gaps in travel during a plan (such as 1 day of travel and then 3 days break before the next travel day).
> - User experience is **very** lacking, using input prompts instead of UI elements and other possibly bad practice.

This project was intended as a **barebones prototype** and to be created quickly, with basic functionality prioritised in order to to test the concept.
