# Travel Planner

This is for creating physical printed tables for travel days and individual journeys per day(s), as well as adding useful transport information and specific notes attached to each travel leg. It also attaches a spare row at the bottom of the table so that extra plans can be added or altered plans can be made if required. 

------
> [!NOTE]
> What this planner does **not** do
> - Making notes / logs of journeys or transportation detail
> - Does not account for gaps in travel during a plan (such as 1 day of travel and then 3 days break before the next travel day).
> - User experience and design could be deemed as 'lacking'.

This project was intended as a quick tool, created to be developed quickly, with basic functionality prioritised.
