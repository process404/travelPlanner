## Travel Planner

This was mainly created out of a desire to create physical printed table timetables involving my travel legs, useful transport info and specific notes attached to each travel leg. It's a barebones, site with many areas of the user experience that could use improvement (e.g using actual UI instead of JavaScript prompts for adding / editing information), but it was not intended to be a public tool so therefore basic functionality was prioritised.
