# Travel Planner

This was created to enable creatng physical printed tables for travel days and individual journeys per day(s), aswell as adding useful transport info and specific notes attached to each travel leg. It also attaches a spare row at the bottom of the table so that extra plans can be added or altered plans can be made if required. 

What this planner does **not** do
- Making notes of journeys or transportation info
- Does not account for gaps in travel e.g 1 day of travel and then 3 days no travel before the next travel day all within one plan.
- User experience is **very** lacking, using input prompts instead of UI elements and other possibly bad practice.
  - This project was intended as a barebones prototype and to be created quickly, with basic functionality prioritised in order to to test the concept.
