# Travel Planner

This was created to enable creatng physical printed tables for travel days and individual journeys per day(s), aswell as adding useful transport info and specific notes attached to each travel leg. It also attaches a spare row at the bottom of the table so that extra plans can be added or altered plans can be made if required. It's a barebones, site with many areas of the user experience that could use improvement (e.g using actual UI instead of JavaScript prompts for adding / editing information), but it was intended to be very much a prototype so therefore basic functionality was prioritised so that the idea could be turned into reality and put into use as quickly and easily as possible.
